### Intro to Forster's List
* Foster's list is implemented in this application as one long list of todos.
* One input field for you to add new todos.
* A list of completed or dismissed items.
* An option to move items into an idea bucket. More about that later.

**Getting started**

You start by adding your todos to the list of items to get done.

> **Caution**: Only enter "to do" items, not **events**. Events have a date/time for when this is happening. All your events should be added to a calendar, preferably with a reminder set so you don't miss them. Tasks on the other hand are items you want to do or work on, and that don't have to be done on a precise date or time. Like picking up around the house, implement feature b, call auntie to catch up etc.


**Here is the basic work through.**
Once you added your todos.

* Read through your list of open items without taking action.
* Have a second, slower read through your list until one item stands out.  Click on it to focus in.
* Work on that item for as long as you like.
  * If you have not finished the todo yet, click "Worked on it" and it will be re-entered at the bottom of the list.
  * If you finished it click "Mark as Completed"
* Rinse and repeat this process.
* If you run over an item that just does not want to get done. Don't keep it in the list,  but mark it as dismissed or move it to the ideas section.
