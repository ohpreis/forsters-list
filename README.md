### A Short Introduction to using Forster's List
>To learn about the methodology visit [Mark Forster's website](http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/)


* Foster's list is implemented as one long list of todos.
* It provides a space for completed tasks and ideas. That's it.

**Getting started**

Start by adding your todos.

> **A word of caution**: Only add "to do" items and not **events**. Events have a date/time for when something is or has to happen. Events should be added to a calendar app, preferably with a reminder set so you don't miss them.


**Here is the basic workflow.**
Assuming you have a list of todos

* Read through your list of open items without taking action.
* Have a second, slower read through your list until one item stands out.  Click on the item to focus in.
* Work on that item for as long as you like.
  * If you did not finish the todo, mark it as "Done". It will be moved to the bottom of the list.
  * If you finished the todo click "Close!" - Congratulations! The completed task is closed and moved under the "Done" tab.
* Rinse and repeat this process.
* If you run over an item that just does not want to get done. Don't keep it in the list,  but mark it as "Dissed" or move it to the ideas section.

I strongly recommend reading through [David Forster's](http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/) instructions before getting to involved with the Forster's List Application.
