# Forster's List

> A simple todo list based on David Forster's "Autofocus Time Management" methodology.

You can read all about David Forster's way of doing To Dos on his website. http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/

### A short intro
The system consists of one long list of everything you want to get done, a single text field and a somewhat grayed out list of items you already completed or dismissed. That's it.

Start with adding todos
Add new to dos as you think of them. Everything new is added to the bottom of the list.  

> **Caution**: Only enter "to do" items, and not events. You easily can spot events if there is a date and time attached, like your next dentist appointment or the meeting with your boss next Wednesday at 11 a.m. Events are items should be added to your calendar, preferably with a reminder set so you don't miss them.


**Here is the basic work through.**

* Read through your list of open items without taking action.
* Have a second, slower run through your list until one item stands out.  Click on it to focus in.
* Work on that item for as long as you like.
  * If you have not finished the todo yet, click "Worked on it" and it will be re-entered at the bottom of the list. If you finished it click "Mark as Completed"
* Rinse and repeat this process.
* If you run over an item that just does not get done. Don't keep it in the list but mark it as dismissed.
