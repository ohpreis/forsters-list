## Installaling the App
Forster's List is build using the awesome Meteorjs framework. So first install
Meteor on your computer. (http://meteor.com).

Download and extract the zip file.
Open a terminal window, change into the forsters-list-master directory and run meteor.

    meteor run

Open you browser [http://localhost:3000]

You need to create a login first. Click the "Sign in" link to create your account.
Once you have logged in you are ready to get started.


### Intro to Forster's List
* Foster's list is implemented as one long list of todos.
* One input field for you to add new todos.
* A list of completed or dismissed items.

**Getting started**

You start by adding your todos to get done.

> **A word of caution**: Only enter "to do" items and not **events**. Events have a date/time for when it is happening. Events should be added to a calendar app, preferably with a reminder set so you don't miss them.


**Here is the basic work through.**
Once you added your todos.

* Read through your list of open items without taking action.
* Have a second, slower read through your list until one item stands out.  Click on the item to focus in.
* Work on that item for as long as you like.
  * If you did not finish the todo, mark it as "Worked on" and it will be re-entered at the bottom of the list.
  * If you finished the todo click "Done!" - Congratulations!
* Rinse and repeat this process.
* If you run over an item that just does not want to get done. Don't keep it in the list,  but mark it as "Dismissed" or move it to the ideas section.

I recommend reading through [David Forster's](http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/) instructions before getting started.
