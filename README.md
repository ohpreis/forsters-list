> A simple todo list based on David Forster's "Autofocus Time Management" methodology.

### A short intro
The system consists of one long list of everything you want to get done, a single text field and a somewhat grayed out of items you have completed. That's it. 

Add new to do's as you think of them. Everything new is added to the bottom.  

> **Coution**: Only enter "to do" items and not events. You easily spot events if there is a date and time attached, like your next dentist appointment. This item should be added to your calendar, perferably with a reminder set so you don't miss it. 


Here is the basic work through.

* Read through your list of open items without taking any action. 
* Go through your list more slowly until one stands out. Click on it focus in.
* Work on that item for as long as you feel like it.
  * If you have not finished it yet, click "Worked on it" and it will be re-entered at the bottom of the list. If you finished it click "Mark as Completed"
* Rinse and repeat this process.
